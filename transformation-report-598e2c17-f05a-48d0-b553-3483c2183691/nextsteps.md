# Next Steps

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the projects in the solution. Below are recommended steps to validate and deploy your migrated project.

## 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the solution root to ensure all NuGet packages are properly restored:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to package compatibility or deprecated packages targeting older frameworks.

## 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full solution build to confirm the absence of errors in a clean build context:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Address any warnings that surface during this step, particularly those related to nullable reference types or platform compatibility, as these can indicate latent issues.

## 3. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to verify that behavior has not changed during migration:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review test output carefully. Any failing tests should be investigated to determine whether they reflect a regression introduced by the migration or a pre-existing issue.

## 4. Verify Target Framework

Open each `.csproj` file and confirm that the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended cross-platform .NET version, for example:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

Ensure no projects are still referencing `net48` or other Windows-only framework monikers unless that is intentional.

## 5. Check for Windows-Specific APIs

Use the .NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer or the `Microsoft.DotNet.PlatformAbstractions` tooling to scan for any remaining Windows-specific API calls. You can also use the built-in Roslyn analyzer by adding the following to your `.csproj`:

```xml
<EnableNETAnalyzers>true</EnableNETAnalyzers>
<AnalysisMode>All</AnalysisMode>
```

Pay particular attention to usages of `System.Windows.Forms`, `System.Drawing`, `Microsoft.Win32`, or P/Invoke calls that may not behave consistently across platforms.

## 6. Test on Target Platforms

Run and validate the application on each platform you intend to support, for example Windows, Linux, and macOS. Functional behavior, file path handling, and environment-specific configurations should all be verified manually on each target OS.

## 7. Review Configuration Files

Check that any `app.config` or `web.config` files have been migrated to `appsettings.json` or the appropriate .NET configuration model. The legacy XML-based configuration system has limited support in modern .NET.

## 8. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application using:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

For a self-contained deployment targeting a specific runtime, use:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --runtime linux-x64 --self-contained true --output ./publish
```

Replace `linux-x64` with the appropriate runtime identifier for your target environment.
