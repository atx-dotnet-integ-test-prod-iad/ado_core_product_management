# Next Steps

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the projects in the solution. Below are recommended steps to validate and deploy your migrated project.

## 1. Verify Target Framework

Open `AdoCore.csproj` and confirm the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended .NET version (e.g., `net8.0` or `net6.0`). Example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## 2. Restore and Build Locally

Run the following commands from the solution root to confirm a clean restore and build:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Ensure there are no warnings that could indicate deprecated APIs or packages that may cause runtime issues.

## 3. Review NuGet Package Versions

Check that all NuGet dependencies in `AdoCore.csproj` are referencing versions compatible with your target framework. Run the following to identify outdated packages:

```bash
dotnet list package --outdated
```

Update any packages that have newer stable versions available.

## 4. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute the test suite to verify that behavior has not changed during migration:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review any failing tests carefully, as they may indicate runtime behavioral differences between the legacy .NET Framework and the new cross-platform .NET runtime.

## 5. Check for Platform-Specific API Usage

Review the codebase for any APIs that were available in .NET Framework but are not fully supported or behave differently in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Drawing` (requires additional packages on non-Windows platforms)
- `Microsoft.Win32` registry access
- Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) client/server usage
- `AppDomain` usage
- `BinaryFormatter` (deprecated and disabled by default)

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.PlatformAbstractions` tooling to identify remaining compatibility concerns.

## 6. Test on Target Operating Systems

If cross-platform support is a goal, run and validate the application on each intended operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) to surface any platform-specific runtime issues that do not appear at build time.

```bash
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

## 7. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application using the appropriate runtime identifier for your deployment target:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --runtime win-x64 --self-contained false
```

Replace `win-x64` with the appropriate runtime identifier (e.g., `linux-x64`, `osx-x64`) based on your deployment environment. Use `--self-contained true` if you want to bundle the .NET runtime with the output.

## 8. Verify Output Artifacts

After publishing, confirm the output directory contains the expected assemblies and configuration files, and perform a smoke test of the deployed application in a staging environment before promoting to production.
