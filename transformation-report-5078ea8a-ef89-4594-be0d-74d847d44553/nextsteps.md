# Next Steps

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. There are no build errors present in the solution. Below are steps to validate, test, and deploy your migrated project.

## 1. Verify Target Framework

Open `AdoCore.csproj` and confirm the target framework is set to the intended cross-platform .NET version (e.g., `net6.0`, `net7.0`, or `net8.0`):

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## 2. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the solution root to ensure all NuGet packages are restored correctly:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings about deprecated packages or version conflicts.

## 3. Build the Solution

Perform a full build to confirm there are no errors or warnings that may have been missed:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Address any warnings that could indicate runtime issues, such as nullable reference warnings or obsolete API usage.

## 4. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to verify that existing functionality has not regressed:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review the test results and investigate any failures, as they may indicate behavioral differences between the legacy .NET Framework and the new cross-platform .NET runtime.

## 5. Check for Platform-Specific API Usage

Review the codebase for any APIs that were available in .NET Framework but are not fully supported or behave differently in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` references (not available in cross-platform .NET)
- Windows Registry access (`Microsoft.Win32.Registry`)
- WCF server-side components
- `AppDomain` usage
- `BinaryFormatter` (deprecated and disabled by default)

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.PlatformAbstractions` tooling to identify remaining compatibility concerns.

## 6. Test on Target Platforms

Since the goal is cross-platform support, run and validate the application on each intended operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS):

```bash
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

Pay attention to file path separators, environment variable handling, and any OS-specific behavior.

## 7. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application for the target runtime. For a self-contained deployment:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --runtime linux-x64 --self-contained true
```

Or for a framework-dependent deployment:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release
```

Review the contents of the `publish` output directory to confirm all required assets are present before deploying to the target environment.
